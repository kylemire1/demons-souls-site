# Storm King

Storm King is a Boss in Demon's Souls and Demon's Souls Remake. Bosses are special enemies that feature their own arena, a large and prominent health bar with its name indicated, a variety of unique moves and abilities, an ambient boss theme, and an Archstone that appears upon their death. Most bosses appear once the player passes through a fog gate nearby.

## Lore
The Storm King is an oversized storm beast with a large multi-spear attack which homes in on the player's location.
