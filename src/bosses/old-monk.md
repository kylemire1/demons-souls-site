# Old Monk

Old Monk is a Boss in Demon's Souls and Demon's Souls Remake. Bosses are special enemies that feature their own arena, a large and prominent health bar with its name indicated, a variety of unique moves and abilities, an ambient boss theme, and an Archstone that appears upon their death. Most bosses appear once the player passes through a fog gate nearby.

## Lore
The Old Monk is a black phantom that was summoned by the original Old Monk and is now being controlled by the golden robes. The original Old Monk was the husband of the queen of Latria, due to his depraved nature, he was banished from Latria and later returned with horrible demons in tow and new power emanating from his new Golden Robe. This caused the destruction of Latria.

The Old Monk's collar indicates: "Head wrappings that were once the golden robe worn by the old master of Latria and eventually took control of the then withered old man. It is whispered that the robe now seeks to summon those who offer their aid, and carrying out its wishes grants them the use of these odd head wrappings. Could the golden garb be seeking out a new vessel to subjugateâ€¦?"
